# EbayScraperWPF
So the plan is to create an ebay bot that scrapes uses the Ebay API to find items that you want to purchase.

Current project is built in Visual Studio 2022 in WPF.

Here are the steps:
1. Create the form to input a new Item
  a. Originally thought I might want to have many Item Inputs on the form but now Im thinking just one add Item pop-up. That way you can do a lot more with the form
2. Use Ebay API to find the Item and Output the information to a text file
3. Set up alert system to get notifications based on how long the item is on Auction for, the current bidding price and so on.
4. Set up an Alert  system for when the Item goes past the Max Price of the Item
5. Create an Input for non_scraped user inputted urls to check on
6. Upgrade to send an Email first to an Email amd Second an Email to a text message
7.Sign into the Ebay System, Need form for sign-in, encryption, information, etc.
7. Create a reply system to the email to send a call to the bot to buy the Item
8. Send an SMS encrypted Message to phone number for better usage
9.???

Beyond-- Create a Android/IOS application that will either do this or communicate with the bot on the Users computer, server or w/e.
