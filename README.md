# EbayScraperWPF
This will just deal with the Windows form that will interact with the database and python script.

Create a form that a user can input items and details of the item the user wishes to search for.
The Application will then call a python bot application using Windows Pipe that will search for the item.
Python Bot will dump data into a database that will be pulled from by the form Application and displayed.
